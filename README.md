🌍 Understanding TB: Global Cases, Deaths & Progress (1990–2013)

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard that explores the global burden of Tuberculosis (TB) from 1990 to 2013. It visualizes key indicators such as incidence, prevalence, and mortality using WHO data, helping users uncover trends, regional patterns, and public health insights.

📊 Key Features

- KPI Cards: Quick view of total TB cases, deaths, and people living with TB
- Line Charts: Trends in TB incidence, prevalence, and deaths over time
- Stacked Bar Chart: TB deaths by country comparison
- Pie Chart: Regional share of new TB cases
- Ranked Table: Top 10 countries by TB prevalence
- Slicers: Interactive filtering by year, region, and country

🧠 Insights

- Steady decline in new TB cases and deaths after 2005
- High TB burden in South-East Asia and Africa
- Clear evidence of progress, but challenges remain in high-incidence regions
